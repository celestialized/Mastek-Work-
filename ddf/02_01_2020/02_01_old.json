One of the whiskies spends its entire maturation period in an ex sherry cask. The other three, after spending 15 years in refill casks, were then placed into Oloroso sherry casks for 4 years of additional maturation to develop the subtle sherry influence that adds an extra layer of luxury, respectfully complementing the classic ABERFELDY taste profile of soft fruits, toasted cereals and smooth honey aromas.\n</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><div class='img-cont'><img style='width:384px' alt='' src='/file/general/IMG_Aberfedly_1097.jpg'><span></span></div><p style='text-align:justify'>Available from 1 November 2019 at 13 Dubai Duty Free stores across Dubai International Airport, <b>ABERFELDY 19YO Exceptional Cask Small Batch</b> is presented in special edition packaging, including bottle numbering, that celebrates its exclusivity at Dubai International and provides an exciting proposition for single malt connoisseurs and collectors as well as enticing new generations of adult whisky drinkers.  In a further celebration of the ABERFELDY heritage that will intrigue and delight whisky lovers, one of the actual sherry casks used in the ageing will travel from the ABERFELDY distillery to Dubai as part of a in-store sales presentation in December, sharing the historic craft, texture and aroma of the ABERFELDY ageing process.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>As the world’s fastest growing single malt ABERFELDY was listed as the tenth-largest single malt in global travel retail (IWSR 2018), having accelerated year on year from being in 18th position in 2013. Maintaining the ongoing commitment to age statements at a time when many are disappearing from labels, ABERFELDY is continuing to release liquid with guaranteed age statements, which are perceived as a key purchase motivation in travel retail and a driver of category growth.  The appeal of ABERFELDY is also driven by its unusual provenance, with the distillery’s water sourced from the Pitilie Burn, renowned for its alluvial deposits of Scottish gold. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Sandeep Chugh, Regional Manager, Middle East and Africa, Bacardi Global Travel comments: 'The ABERFELDY Exceptional Cask 19YO Sherry Finish is a truly remarkable addition to the Exceptional Cask series and we are delighted to partner with Dubai Duty Free in bringing this limited edition to DXB.

At the time Dubai Duty Free was a sponsor of DIFF and over the course of the festival Jim met with several members of the management team at Dubai Duty Free including Colm McLoughlin, the Executive Vice Chairman of Dubai Duty Free and Sinead El Sibai, Senior Vice President of Marketing. The trio chatted many times with Jim remarking that he was really amazed by the level of skill and standard of films that were being made in the Arab world. Sometime later, Zahara Moufid, a Moroccan film maker living in Dublin asked Jim if would be interested in working with her on an Arabian themed film festival in Dublin. The aim, Zahara suggested, was to share some of the best Arab and North African films with Irish audiences. Jim thought it was fabulous idea and approached Dubai Duty Free to see if it might be an interesting project for the airport retailer to get involved with.  Fortunately, it was, and Dubai Duty Free agreed to become the presenting sponsor of the Dublin Arabic Film Festival in 2014. That same year, Omar Sharif, the acting legend and one of the greatest movie stars of all time was the guest of honour in the first edition of DAFF.  In its inaugural year the festival showcased some of Omar’s classic movies including <i>Lawrence of Arabia and the last piece of work he made before he died, Monsieur Ibrahim.</i>\n</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>This year’s festival will include five films at the IFI including the curtain-raiser <b><i>The Reports on Sarah and Saleem</i></b>, Muayad Alayan’s drama centred on the clandestine affair between a Palestinian deliveryman and an Israeli cafe owner.

The links between Ireland and the Arab world continue to grow stronger with each passing year, and we have seen that through the number of Irish people travelling to Dubai for both business and leisure, as well as UAE nationals visiting Ireland. Ireland has been doing business with the UAE for many years and it is important to continually build on our core business and cultural relationships.'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>According to Tourism Ireland, screen tourism to Ireland is a growing trend with 71,000 travellers from the Gulf visiting Ireland last year. The UAE is the biggest market, with 51% of GCC visitors coming from the Emirates. Popular series such as <i>Game of Thrones</i> and the latest series of <i>Star Wars</i> films have been shot at various locations in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, providing a welcome boost to the tourism economy.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Attending the opening night of DAFF on the 4th of October, will be Dubai Duty Free’s Senior Vice President of Marketing, Sinead El Sibai, a Dublin native who has been living in Dubai for over 30 years. Sinead is married to a Lebanese man and enjoys a multi-cultural work life balance in the Middle Eastern city.  The glitzy red carpet night will be attended by all of the Arab ambassadors including the UAE Ambassador to Ireland <i>H.E. Mr. Sultan Mohamed Majed Al Ali</i>, Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates. Other special guests on the night will include actor, Liam Cunningham, Moroccan film makers Nour Eddine Lakhmari and Kadija Alami who will be accompanied by The Moroccan Ambassador, H.E. Mr. Lahcen Mahraoui and representatives of associate sponsor, The Arab Irish Chamber of Commerce.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Speaking in advance of DAFF Sinead said, 'Dubai Duty Free is no stranger to the arts and was a founding sponsor of the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF). Our company is a sponsor of the annual Emirates Airline Festival of Literature and we sponsor ChoirFest Middle East.  The Dubai Duty Free’s own choral ensemble, ‘The Dubai Duty Free Nightingales’ have been awarded 'Best A Cappella Performance' at the ChoirFest Middle East 2019. The 22-member Dubai Duty Free choir features full time employees representing a number of different departments, including Marketing, Finance, IT, HR, Corporate Responsibility, Customer Service and Operations. The Dubai Duty Free choral ensemble has participated in the ChoirFest ME for the past six years and has won four times: winning the 'Best Corporate Choir' three times (2015/2017/2018) and the 'Most Dynamic Choir' in 2016.DAFF is a premium festival and offers audiences an interesting insight into Arab culture.  We enjoy working with the team and are looking forward to another great film festival'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>In the UK Dubai Duty Free sponsor horse racing in Newbury and Ascot and in Ireland, the company is the title sponsor of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby and the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open.  The company also owns and run the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships which is a major tennis tournament held in February each year.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Over the past five years, DAFF has attracted dedicated movie fans, directors and actors from all over the world including Dubai, Egypt and Morocco. International and Irish famous faces at the festival over the years include Omar Sharif, U2’s, The Edge, actress Amy Huberman, singer Damien Dempsey, and ambassadors from several Arab countries.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Commenting on this year’s programme, Jim Sheridan said, 'This year there is a common theme of displacement which runs through many of the films we have selected. We live in strange times, where it quite often seems that society is becoming less tolerant of different cultures. This festival aims to embrace difference and to encourage tolerance. It further aims to create greater understanding of the Arab world, its people and the wonderful films that are currently being made in the region. It is also a huge honour for us that two Moroccan filmmakers, director, Nour Eddine Lakhmari and producer, Khadija, Alami will also join us for the festival bringing it to a close on Sunday, 6th October.  Both film makers have great talent and will take questions about the filmmaking in the Arab world after <b><i>Burnout</i></b> screens on final day.' Jim continued, 'I also want to take use this opportunity to thank Zahara Moufid who co-curated this festival for her great work. We hope the audiences will enjoy the choice of the movies as much as we do'.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Featuring stand-out performances from Adeeb Safadi and Sivane Kretchner, <b><i>The Reports on Sarah and Saleem</i></b> focuses on a clandestine affair between a Palestinian deliveryman and an Israeli café owner, both seeking to escape the pressures of their respective marriages. The two live on opposite sides of Jerusalem, and the risk of exposure comes at a great cost. When a late-night tryst in Bethlehem goes awry, the repercussions turn their romance into a minor international crisis involving the secret police, forced confessions and Saleem’s arrest in Israel under false charges.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Saudi poetess Hissa Hilal made headlines around the world as the first woman to ever make it to the final of <i>Million’s Poet</i>, an Abu-Dhabi based multi-million dollar reality television show. It is the Arab world’s biggest poetry competition, and is dominated by men. In her poems, Hissa criticises the patriarchal Arab society and she attacks one of the most notorious Saudi clerics for his extremist fatwas, live, in front of 75 million viewers. Stephanie Brockhaus and Andreas Wolff's <b><i>The Poetess</i></b> tells the story of a woman who grabs the opportunity to speak up against religious extremism and stand up for a peaceful Islam.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Set in 2012 at the beginning of the war in Syria, <b><i>The Day I Lost My Shadow</i></b> sees a young pharmacist in Damascus struggling to give her son as normal a childhood as possible. With water, gas and electricity in short supply, Sana sets off on a search that becomes increasingly dangerous when she encounters both her worst fears and the kindness of strangers.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Animated film recommended for age 12+ <b><i>The Tower</i></b> centres on Wardi, an eleven-year-old Palestinian girl, living with her whole family in the refugee camp where she was born. Her beloved great-grandfather Sidi was one of the first people to settle in the camp after being chased from his home back in 1948. The day Sidi gives her the key to his old house back in Galilee, she fears he may have lost hope of someday going home. Wardi goes looking for his lost hope around the camp, collecting her family’s testimonies along the way.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>The festival's closing film, Nour Eddine Lakhmari's <b><i>Burnout</i></b>, examines the interconnected destinies of three disparate characters in the Moroccan metropolis of Casablanca. A thirteen-year-old shoe-shine boy dreams of buying a prosthesis for his one-legged mother; a middle-aged entrepreneur wants to free himself from the obsessions of his late father; and a 25-year old hospital intern leads a dangerous double life as an escort for wealthy clients. The screening of <i>Burnout</i> will be followed by a Q&A with the film's director Nour Eddine Lakhmari and producer Khadija Alami.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><a href='javascript:history.back();' style='float:right;'>&lt;&lt;Back</a></div>",

'She was second in the very first two-year-old race here last April, this was her first go at seven furlongs, and she carries the same blue and white diamond colours as my Middle Park Stakes runner at Newmarket next Saturday'.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Dubai Duty Free is responsible for no fewer than nine of the meeting’s 14 scheduled races, the first of which was the  £25,000 Dubai Duty Free Handicap over twelve furlongs for three-year-olds and upwards.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>A small but select field of handicappers were led home by the filly Shailene whose victory owed much to the champion jockey elect, Oisin Murphy. He was riding for the trainer who guided his apprentice career, Andrew Balding. 'Andrew was sweet on her chances,' said Murphy who had to work hard in the boiling heat to overcome favourite Soto Sizzler. Shailene was rewarded for several  near-misses in Group company and will be a valuable addition to her American owner George Strawbridge’s broodmare band.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><a href='javascript:history.back();' style='float:right;'>&lt;&lt;Back</a></div>",

We live in strange times, where it quite often seems that society is becoming less tolerant of different cultures. This festival aims to embrace difference and to encourage tolerance. It further aims to create greater understanding of the Arab world, its people and the wonderful films that are currently being made in the region. It is also a huge honour for us that two Moroccan filmmakers, director, Nour Eddine Lakhmari and producer, Khadija, Alami will also join us for the festival bringing it to a close on Sunday, 6th October.  Both film makers have great talent and will take questions about the filmmaking in the Arab world  after <b>Burnout</b> screens on final day.' Jim continued, 'I also want to take use this opportunity to thank Zahara Moufid who co-curated this festival for her great work. We hope the audiences will enjoy the choice of the movies as much as we do'. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Colm McLoughlin, Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Dubai Duty Free, the presenting sponsor of DAFF said, 'Dubai Duty Free is happy to be the presenting sponsor of the Dublin Arabic Film Festival once again. We first started our sponsorship of the festival in 2014. That year, the legendary Omar Sharif was the guest of honour and helped to promote the great work that Arab film makers and actors are doing all around the world. This festival has continued to promote Arab culture through the medium of film and fits with our sponsorship portfolio of the arts and cultural events. We wish the curators of the festival, Zahara Moufid and Jim Sheridan the very best of luck in their endeavours and look forward to yet another great festival of film and culture.'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Ross Keane, IFI Director, added, 'The IFI is proud to partner with the Dublin Arabic Film Festival for its sixth edition. The programme once again showcases the strong and diverse output of Middle Eastern and North African cinemas, exploring a wide range of socially and culturally significant stories and experiences. The festival continues to play a hugely important role in our annual exhibition calendar, and we look forward to welcoming the festival and Liam Cunningham, its inaugural patron, to the IFI this October.'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Featuring stand-out performances from Adeeb Safadi and Sivane Kretchner, <b>The Reports on Sarah and Saleem</b> focuses on a clandestine affair between a Palestinian deliveryman and an Israeli café owner, both seeking to escape the pressures of their respective marriages. The two live on opposite sides of Jerusalem, and the risk of exposure comes at a great cost. When a late-night tryst in Bethlehem goes awry, the repercussions turn their romance into a minor international crisis involving the secret police, forced confessions and Saleem’s arrest in Israel under false charges.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Saudi poetess Hissa Hilal made headlines around the world as the first woman to ever make it to the final of Million’s Poet, an Abu-Dhabi based multi-million dollar reality television show. It is the Arab world’s biggest poetry competition, and is dominated by men. In her poems, Hissa criticises the patriarchal Arab society and she attacks one of the most notorious Saudi clerics for his extremist fatwas, live, in front of 75 million viewers. Stephanie Brockhaus and Andreas Wolff's <b>The Poetess</b> tells the story of a woman who grabs the opportunity to speak up against religious extremism and stand up for a peaceful Islam. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Set in 2012 at the beginning of the war in Syria, <b>The Day I Lost My Shadow</b> sees a young pharmacist in Damascus struggling to give her son as normal a childhood as possible. With water, gas and electricity in short supply, Sana sets off on a search that becomes increasingly dangerous when she encounters both her worst fears and the kindness of strangers.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Animated film recommended for age 12+ <b>The Tower</b> centres on Wardi, an eleven-year-old Palestinian girl, living with her whole family in the refugee camp where she was born. Her beloved great-grandfather Sidi was one of the first people to settle in the camp after being chased from his home back in 1948. The day Sidi gives her the key to his old house back in Galilee, she fears he may have lost hope of someday going home. Wardi goes looking for his lost hope around the camp, collecting her family’s testimonies along the way.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align:justify'>The festival's closing film, Nour Eddine Lakhmari's <b>Burnout</b>, examines the interconnected destinies of three disparate characters in the Moroccan metropolis of Casablanca. A thirteen-year-old shoe-shine boy dreams of buying a prosthesis for his one-legged mother; a middle-aged entrepreneur wants to free himself from the obsessions of his late father; and a 25-year old hospital intern leads a dangerous double life as an escort for wealthy clients.

Kildare (Ireland) from June 27th-29th.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby is the feature event of the festival of high-octane racing (Sat 29th June), with the best horses, jockeys and trainers in the world taking each other on in front of an enthralled audience revelling in supreme hospitality.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby Festival has grown beyond recognition since the world’s leading airport retailer took on the role of sponsor in 2008. The centrepiece, the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby, has become one of the premier races in the global calendar, with prize money increasing incrementally to the current €1.5 million, making it Ireland’s richest race.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>This has guaranteed quality participants. Indeed in 2017, the colts’ Classic was rated the top three-year-old race in the world, as the Seamie Heffernan-ridden Capri provided trainer Aidan O’Brien with a staggering 12th triumph in the mile-and-a-half contest.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Fame And Glory (2009), Cape Blanco (2010), Treasure Beach (2011) and Camelot (2012) went on to complete a seven-in-row for O’Brien (Dylan Thomas and Soldier Of Fortune claiming the spoils in 2006 and 2007). Camelot’s success was particularly memorable in that O’Brien’s then 19-year-old son Joseph was in the saddle.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Trading Leather was a very popular winner in 2013, bridging a 21-year gap for trainer Jim Bolger from his previous triumph with St Jovite in 1992. This had a strong family link too as the Coolcullen maestro not only trained Trading Leather, but also bred him, while he was owned by Bolger’s wife Jackie and ridden by their son-in-law Kevin Manning.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Aidan and Joseph O’Brien combined once more for glory in 2014 with Australia, before John Gosden and William Buick joined forces with Jack Hobbs for the first English-trained victor since Balanchine, owned by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum’s Godolphin racing operation, beat the boys in 1994.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The County of Kildare had a very local success in 2016, as the Aga Khan-owned Harzand made the short trip from Dermot Weld’s Rosewell House to claim the honours under Pat Smullen. Capri led home a stellar field in the 2017 renewal.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Last year supplied another tremendous story when the aforementioned Joseph O’Brien bagged his first Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby as a 25-year-old trainer, his 19-year-old brother Donnacha providing the encouragement from the saddle and denying the siblings’ father Aidan another success in the process.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Dubai Duty Free, Colm McLoughlin said: 'The Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby is always a fantastic contest and last year provided us with a tremendous narrative as Joseph O’Brien, who had ridden the winner of the race twice for his legendary father Aidan, won it for the first time as a trainer with Latrobe, who was ridden by Joseph’s brother Donnacha.'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Dubai Duty Free spends 2.5% of its annual turnover on marketing each year, most of which is dedicated to sports sponsorship. 'Sports sponsorship allows us to reach a global audience via the media exposure that goes with each of events we are involved with', said Colm McLoughlin. 'Each of our sponsorships are very carefully chosen to ensure they align with our potential customer base and the discerning traveller who might consider visiting the vibrant city of Dubai for business or leisure. We are very focused on utilising our sports sponsorship to continue to communicate all that Dubai has to offer.'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>He went on to say, 'Since we took over as title sponsor in 2008 we have been committed to building our association with this prestigious race and to engage with as many communities as possible both on and off the track. That is a key component of all our sponsorship relationships. Away from the track we hold a golf classic at The K Club and for many years we have hosted a charity ball to raise funds for children’s charities.'</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Just a matter of days after the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby takes place, Lahinch Golf Club will host the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open from June 4th-7th, continuing an association that began in 2015.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Given the popularity of horse racing in Dubai, it is no surprise that the global airport retailer also sponsors the Dubai Duty Free Spring Trials Saturday and Dubai Duty Free International Weekend at Newbury, as well as the Dubai Duty Free Shergar Cup at Ascot.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which is owned and organised by Dubai Duty Free, boasts an illustrious roll of honour, attracting the world’s finest tennis players to Dubai. Roger Federer claimed his eighth title earlier this year and his 100th singles career title, while Belinda Bencic made it a Swiss double in the women’s event.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>That this will be the first Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby Festival to be held in the plush, new, state-of-the-art Curragh facility only adds to the attraction and status of what is already an enticing prospect for owners, trainers, racing followers and anyone looking to be entertained.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby Golf Classic is played at The K Club on Thursday June 27th. This four-person team event is played on the Palmer Ryder Cup Course, home of the 2006 Ryder Cup and the 2016 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, making it a super attraction. The winning team will be invited to the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby at the Curragh Racecourse on the Saturday, where they can enjoy full hospitality in the Dubai Duty Free Derby private VIP suite.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>On Friday June 28th, the executive team and their guests from all over the world will attend a charity lunch at The Curragh Racecourse called ‘Under StARTers Orders’ when six life sized horses, made out of fibreglass and painted by leading Irish artists will be sold to raise funds for two charities, Irish Injured Jockeys and Sensational Kids.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>During the three days of racing during the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby Festival, the Curragh Racecourse will be a hive of music, fine food and glamours, with many of those in attendance pursuing the coveted title of Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby Best Dressed Lady.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Courtesy of Dubai Duty Free, the Best Dressed Lady will win a luxury trip to Dubai for two including flights and accommodation at the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel, where she and her guest will stay for five glorious nights.

The tournament is set to be held at Lahinch Golf Club in County Clare for the first time from July 4-7 and it’s a venue, and a county, of great significance to McLoughlin, Dubai Duty Free and the whole duty free industry.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“The duty free industry was started in Shannon Airport, which is close by, in 1947 by Clare man, Dr. Brendan O’ Regan,” said Irishman McLoughlin who joined Shannon Duty Free on June 1st 1969, and is therefore marking 50 years in the duty free industry this month.”</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Colm was general manager of Shannon Duty Free in 1983 when the Government of Dubai contracted the Irish aviation authority, Aer Rianta, to set up Dubai Duty Free and Colm headed up the Irish team. When Dubai Duty Free opened for business in December of that year, Colm was asked to stay on as General Manager and he has continued as head of the operation, which last year recorded record sales of US$2.015 billion.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“As a company, we really liked the choice of Lahinch as venue for this year’s tournament because of that link with Shannon, County Clare and the entire duty free industry. It’s going to be extra special for everyone involved with Dubai Duty Free this year.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Also, my wife Breeda is from County Clare so she’s very happy that the tournament will be played in her home county!” added McLoughlin, who was himself a member of Lahinch Golf Club when he worked in Shannon.”</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Since Dubai Duty Free took over the title sponsorship in 2015, the growth of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open has been astonishing. Already one of golf’s oldest and most historic events, having been played since 1927, it became part of the European Tour’s prestigious eight-event Rolex Series in 2017 which saw the prize fund increase to a whopping US$7 million, making it one of the biggest events on the Race to Dubai schedule. For the past four years four-time Major champion Rory McIlroy has been the figurehead of the tournament but this year marks the start of a new era where the modern greats of the Irish game will form a ‘pool’ of hosts who will rotate each year. First up is 2014 victorious European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley while Major champions Darren Clarke, Padraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell as well as Rory McIlroy will all join the roster.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='img-cont'><img alt='Paul McGinley at the Pro-Am during the 2018 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open' src='/file/general/Paul_McGinley_Pro_Am_DDF_Irish_Open.jpg'><span>Paul McGinley at the Pro-Am during the 2018 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open</span></div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>McGinley too, has a special connection with Lahinch having won the prestigious South of Ireland Championship, which has been played at the venue since 1895, in 1991. The four-time European Tour winner has promised a ‘festival’ vibe at this year’s Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, with music and entertainment featuring alongside the golf and the unusual layout of the stunning Alister MacKenzie designed links course, parts of which meander right into the town, set to create an extra special atmosphere. </p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“The Dubai Duty Free Irish Open has a rich history and tradition of being hosted on great golf courses,” said McGinley. “The Irish heritage is built on fun, sociability and laughter. When asked to become the tournament host I wanted to help create the right environment and canvas to accomplish a meeting of both ideals.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I know Colm has a soft spot for Lahinch from the days he played in County Clare and I have fond memories myself of winning the South of Ireland Championship at Lahinch in 1991. So, Lahinch is that special place for me and Colm and I can’t think of a better place to stage the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open. It’s going to be a wonderful week in spectacular surroundings by the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.”</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>As well a strong Irish contingent of McGinley, Clarke, McDowell, Harrington, Shane Lowry and 2016 Olympian Seamus Power, who was invited to play by Dubai Duty Free, a host of big international names has joined the field including Ryder Cup legends Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood, 2017 Race to Dubai champion Tommy Fleetwood, 2010 Open Champion Louis Oosthuizen, two-time Major champion Martin Kaymer, 2018 winning Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjørn and of course, defending champion Russell Knox.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>It was today announced that Dubai’s favourite adopted son, 2012 Omega Dubai Desert Classic winner Rafa Cabrera Bello, has also added his name to the star-studded field.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The Spaniard has enjoyed some strong results on Irish soil and this year’s event will mark his 11th consecutive appearance.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>His best performance at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open came seven years ago at Royal Portrush – venue for this year’s Open Championship – when the 35 year old birdied three of the final four holes to make a late charge for victory but finished in a share of second behind winner Jamie Donaldson.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I’ve always enjoyed the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open and playing in front of the Irish crowds so I’m really looking forward to going back,” said Cabrera Bello.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I love playing links golf courses and I have heard Lahinch is a true test of golf and with Paul McGinley as host, I am sure it is going to be great week. I have also heard it is a big surfing town so I’m hoping to get out and catch a few waves during the week!”</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='img-cont'><img alt='Colm McLoughlin and Russell Knox, 2018 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open winner' src='/file/general/Colm_McLoughlin_Russell_Knox_DDF_Irish_Open_Winner.jpg'><span>Colm McLoughlin and Russell Knox, 2018 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open winner</span></div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Keith Pelley, Chief Executive Officer of the European Tour, said: “Dubai Duty Free have been an invaluable partner to the European Tour since coming on board as title sponsor of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open in 2015, a relationship which, of course, was elevated last year when they also became an Official Partner of the European Tour.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“The vision and commitment of Colm McLoughlin and his team over these past five years has helped the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open become one of the most prestigious and eagerly anticipated weeks on our calendar and this year is no exception. I know our visit to Lahinch and County Clare has special resonance for Colm and his wife Breeda and, like them, we are all eagerly anticipating another superb week.”</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>McLoughlin added: “We’re pleased with the growth of the tournament and from a sponsorship point of view, we’re happy with the Return On Investment (ROI) that is generated. The TV coverage generated during last year’s tournament is valued at US$158.5 million and of that US$50.2 million is for the DDF brand, and this is one of the key measures by which we gauge the sponsorship’s success.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“We also measure the quality of the players in the field and this year’s line-up is very exciting. Paul McGinley has put in a huge effort to attract many of the top players to confirm, and he has done a great job.”</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The 2019 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open takes place at Lahinch Golf Club from July 4-7</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='img-cont'><img alt='The 2018 Dubai Duty Free Open' src='/file/general/DDF_Free_Open.jpg'><span>The 2018 Dubai Duty Free Open</span></div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <a href='javascript:history.back();' style='float:right;'>&lt;&lt;Back</a></div>",

When I saw the job advertised in Shannon Duty Free I thought “I wonder what that is about”, so I applied for the position mainly to see what the job entailed,” said McLoughlin. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>As fate would have it, McLoughlin was offered the job on the spot and so began his five-decade long career in an industry that was started by Dr. Brendan O’Regan in Shannon in 1947 and is now a global business worth an estimated US$76 billon.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“Dr. Brendan O’Regan was a great man and was the founding father of the duty free industry that we know today. He was not in Shannon in my time, but he was talked about with great respect at all times. When I started in Shannon, I reported to Bill Maloney in the early days. Bill was a great manager and I learnt a lot from him,” added McLoughlin. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The 1970’s witnessed a great deal of expansion and growth at Shannon Airport, which was the major gateway and refueling stop between Europe and the US. In tandem with the growth of the airport, the newly named airport authority, Aer Rianta, had developed a reputation for successfully running the duty free side of the business. In 1983 Shannon was the first port of call for Dubai International Airport’s then Director General, Mr. Mohi-din Binhendi, who was tasked with the job of setting up a duty free operation in Dubai. Mr. Binhendi met with the Aer Rianta senior management, including then General Manager of Shannon Duty Free, Colm McLoughlin.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I remember when Mr. Binhendi visited Shannon and we were excited to hear about the plans he had for setting up a duty free operation in Dubai,” said McLoughlin. “I have to admit though that not many of us knew where Dubai was at that time and we had to look it up. But we were left in no doubt that Dubai meant business and they wanted to open a world class duty free operation very quickly.”</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Within weeks of the visit, Colm McLoughlin moved to Dubai in July 1983 as part of the 10-man team from Aer Rianta at the request of the Dubai Government to set up the duty-free operation as part of a six-month consultancy agreement.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“We had only six months to turn the project round,” remembers McLoughlin. “During that time we had to recruit and train 100 staff, we had to purchase products, we had to establish systems and so on, so we had no time off and worked around the clock. It was worth it though when we opened for business on December 20th and took US$44,000 in that first day and went on to have sales of US$20 million in the first full year.  </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“Fast forward to 2008, when Dubai Duty Free celebrated its 25th anniversary and in one single day, our sales reached US$20 million, which is incredible. Fast forward further to 2019 and it is also incredible that 25 of the original 100 staff are still with the organization”, he added.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Within months of the opening of Dubai Duty Free, Mr. McLoughlin was asked to remain on as General Manager of the new operation. Two other members of the original Aer Rianta team also remained in Dubai including John Sutcliffe, who went on to head up Aer Rianta International based in Bahrain, and George Horan, who became President of Dubai Duty Free in 2011 and retired in 2016. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='img-cont'> <img alt='Colm McLoughlin, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dubai Duty Free was guest of honour at a special 50th Anniversary dinner held in Magnolia in Al Qasr Hotel to mark his 50 years in the duty free industry.

Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Dubai Duty Free. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Commenting on McLoughlin’s 50-year career anniversary, H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said: “I remember in the early days when Dubai Duty Free consisted of a few scattered shops around the airport, now it is a world-leader. Along the way DDF has played a pivotal role in building Dubai’s aviation brand and leadership position.  This is thanks to its excellent management team highlighted by the experienced people who remain in top management. Throughout it all, from day one, Colm McLoughlin has been in charge, leading the way. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I would like to congratulate Colm on marking his 50th year in the duty free business and thank him for all his hard work during his 36 years in Dubai.”</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>In July 2011, Colm McLoughlin was named Executive Vice Chairman & CEO of Dubai Duty Free and its subsidiary businesses, which includes the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium, home to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, The Century Village, the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel and The Irish Village in Garhoud and Riverland, with the third Irish Village outlet opening soon at Studio One Hotel in Dubai Studio City.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='img-cont'> <img alt='Colm McLoughlin, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dubai Duty Free holding the first Frontier Award for “Airport Duty Free Operator of the Year” at the inaugural Frontier Awards held in France in 1985, an award it subsequently won a record nine times including in 2017 and 2018.' src='/file/general/Colm_50_anniv_award.jpg' style='width: 40%;'> <span>Colm McLoughlin, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dubai Duty Free holding the first Frontier Award for “Airport Duty Free Operator of the Year” at the inaugural Frontier Awards held in France in 1985, an award it subsequently won a record nine times including in 2017 and 2018.</span> </div><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='item-title' style='color: black; text-align: justify;'>Awards</div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>From the mid-1980’s onwards, Dubai Duty Free’s reputation as a world class operation began to make the headlines and in October 1985, the operation was named “Airport Duty Free Operator of the Year” at the inaugural Frontier Awards in France, an award it subsequently won a record nine times including in 2017 and 2018. Widely regarded as the “Oscars” of the duty free industry, the Frontier Awards also honoured Colm McLoughlin with a ‘Lifetime Achievement’ award in 2004, making him only the second person after Dr. Brendan O’Regan, to receive the award at that time.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Dubai Duty Free has won in excess of 700 awards over the years, and Mr. McLoughlin has received 70 personal awards from the industry and media alike. Included in this is the Dubai Government Excellence Award for “Most Distinguished Employee in 2000” and the “Irish Presidential Distinguished Service Award” in the Business and Education category in 2014. In 2017, he was conferred by the Middlesex University Dubai with an Honorary Doctorate of the University as part of its celebration of the academic success, and in the same year was honoured with a “Lifetime Achievement Award” at The BURJ CEO Awards organised by CEO Clubs Network.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I do get a lot of credit at times and I am always very mindful of thanking the Dubai Duty Free team and those who work behind the scenes at Dubai Duty Free to ensure that our operation runs 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Of course, I am very appreciative of my own boss, H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who is an absolute superstar and I feel very honoured to have worked closely with him over the years,” added McLoughlin.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='item-title' style='color: black; text-align: justify;'>New Millennium</div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The new millennium brought with it major new changes at Dubai International Airport, including the opening of the new Sheikh Rashid Terminal in April 2000. The new Terminal provided Dubai Duty Free with a stunning new retail operation covering 5,400 square metres. This was a major development for both the airport and the retailer and heralded a new and exciting development in Dubai’s aviation story. By the end of 2000, Dubai Duty Free’s sales reached US$222 million, and that figure grew dramatically as the decade progressed.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>In October 2008, the next major development at Dubai International was unveiled with the opening of Concourse B in Terminal 3, which included an 8,000 square metres Dubai Duty Free retail operation. Dedicated to Emirates Airline, the new Terminal was very well received, and in January 2013 Concourse A opened.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>With the opening of Al Maktoum International Airport in October 2013, and the development of Concourse D in Terminal 1 at Dubai International Airport in February 2016, Dubai Duty Free’s retail footprint grew to a total of 42,000 square metres across both airports.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>On December 20th 2018, Dubai Duty Free celebrated its 35th anniversary and history was made as the retailer crossed the US$2 billion mark in the early morning of 29th December, while annual sales turnover reached a record US$2.015 billion.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>“I never would have thought that I would still be working in this industry 50 years on, and now 36 years in Dubai Duty Free. I appreciate all of the support that I have received over the years and I thank my own family, especially my wife Breeda, for being supportive throughout the years”, said Mr. McLoughlin. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Under McLoughlin’s direction, Dubai Duty Free has become a retailing giant with a reputation for excellence throughout the travel retail industry. Dubai Duty Free currently accounts for around 6% of global airport retail sales and is the largest single airport retailer in the world.  </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='item-title' style='color: black; text-align: justify;'>Sports Marketing </div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Mr. McLoughlin has not only helped shape and influence a multi-billion-dollar industry, he also raised the profile of the city of Dubai as a premium sports and leisure destination through the promotion of high-profile international events.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>A classic example of this is the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which is owned and organised by Dubai Duty Free with H.H. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai as tournament patron.  </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The Championships, which began in 1993 is now a leading tournament on the WTA and ATP Tours and marked its 27th anniversary in 2018. With prize money of US$5.2 million this year’s WTA tournament was won by young Swiss player Belinda Bencic, earning her first Dubai title while fellow Swiss, Roger Federer, earned his 100th singles title of his career, as well as his eighth Dubai title.   Media analysis show that the two-week tournament generated an estimated US$1.3 billion worth of TV exposure for Dubai of which US$445 million is for DDF brand alone.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The airport retailer sponsors other major sporting events including the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby, which takes place at the history Curragh Racecourse in June, and Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, which is part of the Rolex Series and this year takes place in Lahinch in Co. Clare. Over the years, Dubai Duty Free regularly flies the flag in the UK in April and September at the historical Newbury Racecourse, and in August at Ascot for the Dubai Duty Free Shergar Cup.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Other sports to benefit from Dubai Duty Free’s support include the Dubai Duty Free Golf World Cup, the Emirates Airline Dubai Rugby 7’s and the Dubai International Basketball Tournament among others.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='item-title' style='color: black; text-align: justify;'>Dubai Duty Free Leisure</div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium, which was built in 1995 as a permanent venue for the Dubai Championships, led to the opening of the first Irish Village in 1996, a bar and restaurant concept developed by Mr McLoughlin. Built into the stadium structure, The Irish Village is modelled on a traditional Irish street and even features the ‘Ballinasloe Post Office’, which is a nod to McLoughlin’s home town in Ireland.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The award-winning Irish Village opened a second outlet in 2017 at the Dubai Parks and Resorts, while the third outlet will be opening soon at Studio One Hotel, in Dubai Studio City. In addition to The Irish Village, Dubai Duty Free also manage The Century Village, which is located around the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium and features a number of individual restaurants. In July 2012, the operation opened The Jumeirah Creekside Hotel on the nearby site, with the 292-bedroom hotel completing this outstanding sporting, leisure and hospitality complex in Garhoud.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='img-cont'> <img alt='Colm McLoughlin’s 50th anniversary especially designed logo.' src='/file/general/Colm_50_anniv_logo.jpg' style='width: 40%;'> <span>Colm McLoughlin’s 50th anniversary especially designed logo.</span> </div><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <div class='item-title' style='color: black; text-align: justify;'>Dubai Duty Free Foundation</div> <p style='text-align: justify;'>To mark the operation’s 20th Anniversary celebrations in December 2003, Dubai Duty Free offered a 20% discount to travelers on the day and sales roared to a phenomenal US$1.9 million. On the instructions of Mr. McLoughlin, the operation donated the day’s proceeds to nine local charities and this resulted in the formation of the Dubai Duty Free Foundation in 2004. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The Dubai Duty Free Foundation operates under the patronage of HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum with Mr. McLoughlin as Chairman of the Board. To date, the Foundation has supported 40 local and 53 overseas charities including; the Hand in Hand for Haiti, The Moodie Report Great Travel Retail Educathlon, Smile Train and the construction of 32 houses in the DDF GK Village, located in the province of Leyte, Philippines.  </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>In 2018, Mr. McLoughlin was named the “Charity Champion of the Year” at the annual Duty Free News International Global Travel Awards for Travel Retail Excellence in London.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <a href='javascript:history.back();' style='float:right;'>&lt;&lt;Back</a></div>",

The sponsors own this exceptional colt but he was an absentee through slight injury.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Derby-winning trainer Marcus Tregoning (Sir Percy) followed David Elsworth into Whitsbury Stables and his Mohaather landed this important colts’ Guineas trial for owner H.H Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum who has twice won the Greenham in recent years with Tasleet and Muhaarar.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Mohaather loves this course, said Tregoning saddling his best horse since Sir Percy. H.H Sheikh Hamdan and Angus Gold will sit down and we’ll discuss where we go from here with the Guineas the likelihood. He is a lovely laid-back horse with a beautiful action.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Concluding the card and the successful meeting was the Dubai Duty Free Millennium Millionaire Handicap worth £12,000 and featuring a strong field of eighteen. Last year’s race was the last time Lunar Jet had got his head in front, narrowly, for trainer John Mackie who has a small string in the Midlands. This time the gamble was landed far more easily!</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>On the strength of winning last year, I was invited to the Dubai Duty Free lunch this time, said Mackie. I’m delighted to repay the hospitality – speaking for everyone at Newbury who enjoyed the sport and delights of the Dubai Duty Free Spring Trials Weekend and look forward to the 25th in 2020</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <a href='javascript:history.back();' style='float:right;'>&lt;&lt;Back</a></div>",

A refined aesthete and true epicurean, a lover of travel, flowers and gastronomy alike, the Lancôme founder injected the house with the values that distinguish it still today: upholding a tradition of French excellence inherited from the golden age of modern perfumery to create generous and indulgent compositions.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>An exclusive field of expression for this exceptional legacy, Maison Lancôme teams the finest artistic talents with unique expertise to offer a range of fragrances composed, designed and made in France.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In 2019, the collection explores a new facet of the French art of living and thus marks the beginning of the next chapter in its story. In the wake of the Grands Crus, Maison Lancôme is drawing inspiration from French Gardens for its four new creations: Figues & Agrumes, Magnolia Rosae, Patchouli Aromatique and Pivoines Printemps.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;'>French Gardens, a new decor for Maison Lancôme</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>From an afternoon lazing in the grass to a weekend break in the countryside, French gardens are places to commune with nature, to gather with friends and family and share in the simple, precious pleasures of life.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Armand Petitjean had a special love of French gardens, as evinced by those he had magnificently laid out at the Lancôme plantation in Chevilly, known at the time as the 'Versailles of Perfumery'. But above all, this love found expression in the garden of his country home, Les Vallières, a bucolic and romantic haven of peace where the perfumer and his wife grew rare flowers and hosted elegant receptions for their friends and family every Sunday. </p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>By merging this quintessentially French tradition of weekends in the countryside with the historical heritage of the brand, Maison Lancôme has created the modern and elegant framework for its own special olfactory interpretation of the French country garden</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>A perfect garden that extols the beauty of a bountiful and varied nature: tamed with incredible refinement, it gradually reveals its wild charm over the course of a fragrant stroll. From the velvety petal of a flower garden to the delicious flavours of fruit from the orchard and the soft, soothing atmosphere of a majestic wood, the Maison Lancôme garden fills the senses with a profusion of colours and scents, which can be discovered on an immersive and multi-sensory virtual reality experience in stores.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p><div class='img-cont'> <a href='/maison-lancôme-figues-agrumes-100ml/product/111251079'><img alt='Lancôme’s' src='/file/products/111251079.1.jpg' style='margin-right:90%; width:10%;'></a></div><p style='text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;'>Figues & Agrumes</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>By Alex Lee and Patricia Choux</p><p style='text-align: justify;font-style: italic;'>We worked together on the fig, combining our two visions to create a unique interpretation of the fruit.
